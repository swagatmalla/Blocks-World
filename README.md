# Introducing the Blocks World Problem

The Block World Problem is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and robotics that involves manipulating a set of blocks arranged on a table or in stacks to reach a desired goal configuration. The task models real-world planning and manipulation problems, requiring logical reasoning, sequence planning, and often optimization to achieve the goal. The blocks have specific constraints: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and the blocks must remain on the table or stacked on each other.
